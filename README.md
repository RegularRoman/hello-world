# hello-world

Iam Roman, a recently graduated electrical engineer who has taken an interest in revisiting his education in computer science for recreational purposes. 

I have an interest in robotics and all things automation, and I believe that a strong univeersal understading of automation techniques is essential for the future of the world.

If you have any thoughts or projects you would like to include me on, please feel free to reach out.

Thanks for stopping by!
